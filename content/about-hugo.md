Howdy ðŸ¤ , I'm Emilio (Blacksmith) Herrera, a Software Engineer from MÃ©xico, I have a bachelor's degree in "Interactive Design" (UX/UI). And self taught experience transitioning towards Software Development.

I started my Development Journey, in 2017, focused on game development in general, I started using Unity with C# programming language, and ever since I've been doing the transition towards software development focused on full stack web development, the transition started in 2021, I started doing more and more websites and web applications.

And some of the highlights in my work have been developing ["MOTHER FROGGER"](https://emilioblacksmith.itch.io/frogger-but-with-ragdolls), a 3rd Person retro inspired platformer videogame of Frogger, but with ragdoll physics movement, based in videogames like humans fall flat and gang beasts.

A Web Application named: ["The Busy Gamer App"](https://github.com/EmilioBlacksmith/TheBusyGamerWebApp), Web app to track and calculate how long to finish your videogame backlog on a tight schedule, a full stack application developed from scratch with the [How Long to Beat API](https://github.com/EmilioBlacksmith/TheBusyGamerAppAPI), to get an approximate of how long to finish games based on a weekly or daily schedule of gaming.

Currently coming up with new ideas, new services, and overall new experience to experience to enjoy.
